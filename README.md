# The X-Files

For those not familiar with the *The X-Files*, it is a 90s science-fiction show (with a 10th season revival in 2016) with a wonderfully spooky atmosphere (filmed in Vancouver for first 5 seasons) where two FBI agents study alien conspiracies and other paranormal activity. It stars David Duchovny as FBI agent Fox "Spooky" Mulder, an alien conspiracy theorist, and his skeptical partner Doctor Dana Scully, played by Gillian Anderson, as they study unexplained or overlooked cases called 'X-Files'. Scully, with her scientific background and analytical mindset, was assigned to work with Mulder in an effort to debunk his obsessive work studying these cases. However, the longer Scully works with Mulder, the more high-ranking government agents get in the way of her and Mulder's investigations, and the more she begins to believe that there might be a government cover-up... of something.

In the X-Files there are 2 types of episodes: those that feature Mulder and Scully investigating the series-arcing alien conspiracy known as *mytharc* shows, and those that are one-off 'X-Files', often referred to as *Monster of the Week* episodes. The goal of this project is to compare how these two types of episodes compare, and ultimately find out which one is better.

## Two Episodes to Contain Them All

X-Files is not unique in the sense that it has episodes that are self-contained and others that contribute to the series-long plot, but the ability to distinguish between these is considerably easier than in most shows. However it is still imperfect, as sometimes elements of the government conspiracy bleed into *Monster of the Week* (MotW) episodes, and vice-versa. After straining my personal knowledge and memory of the show I decided to work with the classifications done by the phenomenal website http://www.insidethex.co.uk (they have transcribed every episode of the show by-hand!). Their method is to classify episodes as 'mytharc' only if they directly feature elements of the government conspiracy <sup> [1] </sup>. This leans towards more episodes being classified as *MotW* than other methods, but to me it is the most objective way it can be done.

## Data

As in my previous projects I use IMDb's [user ratings of episodes](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106179/epdate?ref_=ttep_ql_3). I chose IMDb mainly because of it's large population of voters (average of over 2000 per episode of The X-Files). There are indeed other sites where users can rate episodes of tv shows, but without as large a community, they are more susceptible to vote-rigging, and thus the ratings are less trustworthy.

The only other big decision for this project is whether or not to include the 10th season revival from 2016. With the series creator and executive producer Chris Carter back on the series along with some of the main writers and other staff <sup> [2] </sup> <sup> [3] </sup> I was tempted to include the 10th season in my analysis, but I believe that still too much time has passed, and too much has changed from the original airing for it to be compared. Sure enough, upon preliminary analysis of the 6-episode revival season, the episode were significantly lower, didn't adhere to certain trends that the other 9 seasons did, and with only 6 episodes didn't lead to much insight. Therefore I chose to only include seasons 1-9 of the original airing in my analysis.
