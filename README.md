# X-Files

With the last few projects being a little more exploratory than I had previously planned, I want this one to be more focused. 

For those not familiar with *The X-Files*, it stars David Duchovny as FBI agent Fox "Spooky" Mulder, an alien conspiracy theorist, and his skeptical partner Doctor Dana Scully, played by Gillian Anderson, as they study unexplained or overlooked cases called 'X-Files'. Scully, with her scientific background and analytical mindset was assigned to work with Mulder in an effort to debunk his obsessive work studying aliens and other paranormal activity. However, the longer Scully works with Mulder, the more high-ranking government agents get in the way of her and Mulder's investigations, and the more she begins to believe that there might be a government cover-up... of something.

In the X-Files there are 2 types of episodes: those that feature Mulder and Scully investigating the series-arcing alien conspiracy known as *mytharc* shows, and those that are one-off 'X-Files', often referred to as *Monster of the Week* episodes. The goal of this project is to compare how these two types of episodes compare, and ultimately find out which one is better.

## Two Episodes to Contain Them All

X-Files is not unique in the sense that it has episodes that are self-contained and others that contribute to the series-long plot, but the ability to distinguish between these is considerably easier than in most shows. However it is still imperfect, as sometimes elements of the government conspiracy bleed into *Monster of the Week* (MotW) episodes, and vice-versa. After straining my personal knowledge and memory of the show, I ultimately decided to work with the classifications done by the truly phenomenal website [http://www.insidethex.co.uk] (they have transcribed every episode of the show by-hand!). Their method is to classify episodes as 'mytharc' only if they directly feature elements of the government conspiracy <sup> [1] </sup>. This leans towards more episodes being classified as *MotW* than other methods, but to me it is the most objective way it can be done.
